MASTER DOCUMENT GENERATION — BUILD RULES (FINALIZED WITH MARKERS, NON-BLOCKING)

THIS TEMPLATE PRODUCES A FULL ARC DOCUMENT MADE OF:
• FILE HEADER (filename line using ARC_CODE)
• PAGE 1 (ARC TITLE + ARC DESCRIPTION)
• PAGE 2+ (SECTION PAGES — each section is its own page)
• Section pages repeat this exact structure for every section in the arc.

GLOBAL FORMATTING RULES:
• ASCII only. Use straight quotes. No emojis.
• Do NOT use any rich-text or Markdown markers (no **, __, _, ~, #, backticks, etc.).
• Do not rewrite, summarize, or “improve” user-provided text.
• Preserve capitalization and punctuation exactly.
• Print fields exactly as labeled below. No extra commentary or lines beyond what is specified.

------------------------------------------------------------
ARC_CODE — GENERATION AND USE (NON-BLOCKING)
------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
• Short code (3–4 characters) that tags all files for the arc.

Input / Default:
• If an ARC_CODE is provided by the user, use it exactly as given.
• If ARC_CODE is NOT provided, AUTO-GENERATE it (do not prompt):
  - 3–4 uppercase characters; A–Z and 0–9 allowed.
  - Derive from the arc title’s significant words.
  - Keep numerals present in the title (e.g., 3I in “3I/ATLAS”).
  - Ignore stopwords (THE, A, AN, AND, OF, TO, FOR).
  - For compound words (slash or hyphen), you may take 1–2 letters from each part to reach 3–4 total.
  - Prefer readability and uniqueness within the project.
  - Examples:
    • 3I/ATLAS Attunement → 3IAT
    • Quantum Jump Primer → QJP
    • Infinite Concentration → ICN
    • Return of the Eight Senses → ROES

Collision handling:
• If the auto-generated ARC_CODE conflicts with an existing arc in the same project, append a digit (e.g., QJP2). Do not prompt; proceed.

Filename line (MUST BE FIRST OUTPUT LINE):
• <ARC_CODE>_arc_breakdown.txt[LB]
• Replace <ARC_CODE> with the generated/provided code.
• Example: QJP_arc_breakdown.txt[LB]

Operator policy:
• Never halt to ask for ARC_CODE. Auto-generate if absent.
• If the user later supplies a different ARC_CODE, accept it and regenerate.
