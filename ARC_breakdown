MASTER DOCUMENT GENERATION — BUILD RULES (updated)

THIS TEMPLATE PRODUCES A FULL ARC DOCUMENT MADE OF:
• FILE HEADER (filename line using ARC_CODE)
• PAGE 1 (ARC TITLE + ARC DESCRIPTION + ARC INTENTION)
• PAGE 2+ (SECTION PAGES — each section is its own page)
• Section pages repeat this exact structure for every section in the arc.

GLOBAL FORMATTING RULES:
• ASCII only. Use straight quotes. No emojis.
• Do NOT use any rich-text or Markdown markers (no **, __, _, ~, #, backticks, etc.).
• Do not rewrite, summarize, or “improve” user-provided text.
• Preserve capitalization and punctuation exactly.
• Print fields exactly as labeled below. No extra commentary or lines beyond what is specified.

------------------------------------------------------------
ARC_CODE — GENERATION AND USE
------------------------------------------------------------
ARC_CODE PURPOSE:
• Short code (3–4 characters) that tags all files for the arc.

ARC_CODE INPUT/DEFAULT:
• Generate an ARC_CODE:
  - 3–4 uppercase characters (A–Z, 0–9 allowed).
  - Derive from the arc title’s significant words.
  - Keep numerals that appear in the title (e.g., 3I in “3I/ATLAS”).
  - Ignore common stopwords (THE, A, AN, AND, OF, TO, FOR).
  - For compound words (slash or hyphen), you may take 1–2 letters from each part to reach 3–4 total.
  - Prefer readability and uniqueness within the project.
  - Examples:
    • 3I/ATLAS Attunement → 3IAT
    • Quantum Jump Primer → QJP
    • Infinite Concentration → ICN
    • Return of the Eight Senses → ROES

FILENAME LINE (MUST BE FIRST LINE OF OUTPUT):

• <ARC_CODE>_arc_breakdown.txt
• Replace <ARC_CODE> with the generated/provided code.
• Example: QJP_arc_breakdown.txt
• After printing the filename line, output exactly two blank lines (two empty newlines with no spaces or tabs), then begin PAGE 1.
• Spacing: Two blank lines must appear between the filename line and ARC TITLE. No other extra blank lines are allowed.

------------------------------------------------------------
PAGE 1 — ARC TITLE + ARC DESCRIPTION — BUILD RULES
------------------------------------------------------------

INPUT FIELDS:
• ARC Name
• ARC Description
• ARC Intention

OUTPUT STRUCTURE (exact):
ARC TITLE:  [ARC Name]

Description:  [ARC Description paragraph(s)]

Intention: [ARC Intention paragraph(s)]

FORMATTING RULES:
• Labels appear exactly as shown above (plain text; not bold).
• ARC TITLE appears first, followed by a colon, then a blank line, then the ARC Name on the next line, then a blank line, then the ARC Intention on the next line.
• The label “Description:” appears exactly as written, followed by the description text on the same line.
• The label “Intention:” appears exactly as written, followed by the description text on the same line.
• No extra commentary, no additional sentences, no generated embellishments.
• Use the ARC Name, Description, and Intention exactly as provided in raw input.
• After printing "Intention: [ARC Intention]" on PAGE 1, emit exactly four blank lines.


------------------------------------------------------------
PAGE 2+ — SECTION PAGE — BUILD RULES
------------------------------------------------------------

INPUT FIELDS PER SECTION:
• Section Number (integer)
• Section Title (text)
• Section Description (one sentence per micro-rules)
• Section Benefit (one sentence per micro-rules)

INPUT FIELDS FOR ALL JUMPS:
(These may be supplied separately from section list)
For each jump (per line):
• Jump Title
• Jump Type
• Jump Description
• Jump Benefit (may contain multiple sentences)
• Jump Section Reference (ex: "Section 2: Learning That Sticks")

PARSING RULES:
• Jump numbering is assigned automatically based on sequence order.
• Jump numbering continues from arc start (so Section 2 begins where Section 1 ended).
• Jumps for each section are determined by matching Section Reference text.
• Jumps are always printed in the exact order they are provided in the jump dataset.

OUTPUT STRUCTURE (exact):

Section [Section Number]: [Section Title]
Description: [Section Description]
Benefit: [Section Benefit]

Jump [jump number]
[Jump Title]
Jump Type: [Jump Type]
Description: [Jump Description]
Benefit: [Jump Benefit]

(then repeat Jump block for all jumps belonging to that section)

SPACING (MANDATORY):
• After the Section Benefit line, emit three blank lines, then start the first Jump of that section.
• Within a Jump block, print the 5 lines with NO blank lines between them:
  Jump [n]
  [Jump Title]
  Jump Type: ...
  Description: ...
  Benefit: ...
• After the Jump Benefit line, emit 1 blank line.
• Between consecutive jumps, there is exactly 1 blank line (created by the rule above).
• After the final Jump of a section, emit 4 blank lines, then start the next Section header.


FORMATTING RULES:
• Do not rewrite or edit any user-provided text.
• Preserve all capitalization and punctuation exactly.
• Benefit may be multiple sentences exactly as provided.
• Each field prints exactly as shown above (plain text labels; no styling).
• No commentary or extra sentences outside this structure.
