- Start with: This section is about
- List EXACTLY three gains: [gain 1], [gain 2], and [gain 3]
- Add ONE practical outcome with "so": ... so [real-life outcome].
- Plain present tense, simple words, ASCII only.

Template
This section is about [gain 1], [gain 2], and [gain 3] so [practical outcome].

Examples
This section is about strengthening your intake, working space, and retrieval so more stays after one read and returns on cue.
This section is about installing spacing, chunking, and multisensory cues so short-term learning becomes durable.
This section is about releasing emotional charge, tagging sources, and rebuilding honest confidence so study choices become clear.

Quick self-check
- Two commas (after gain 1 and gain 2)
- Gains use parallel form (all nouns or all -ing verbs)
- Ends with a period


2) Section Benefits - Micro Rules

Template
The benefit of this section is that you will [benefit 1], [benefit 2], [benefit 3], and [benefit 4].

Examples
The benefit of this section is that you will remember more with fewer re-reads, find names and facts quickly, keep multiple steps in mind without strain, and stay clear under pressure.
The benefit of this section is that you will learn more durably with less cramming, refine skills more cleanly, remember to act at the right time, and spend less total study time.
The benefit of this section is that you will feel less mental noise, reduce false memories, judge more clearly what needs review versus what is already solid, and focus attention on what matters.

3) SECTION DESCRIPTION + BENEFIT (One Paragraph)

Goal
Combine the section’s description and its benefits into one clean, two-sentence paragraph.

Fixed Rules
- Write exactly two sentences total:
  • Sentence 1 = the description (what this section trains; end with a practical "so ..." or equivalent cause→effect).
  • Sentence 2 = the benefits; begin with "The benefit of this section is that you will ..." and list exactly four benefits, comma-separated, with "and" before the last item.
- No section titles in this document.
- Plain language, present tense, ASCII only.

Template
This section [is about/trains/strengthens/etc.] [three concise gains or methods] so [practical result]. The benefit of this section is that you will [benefit 1], [benefit 2], [benefit 3], and [benefit 4].

Examples
