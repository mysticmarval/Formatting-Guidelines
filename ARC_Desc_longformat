ARC DESCRIPTION (LONG FORMAT) FORMATTING GUIDE

Median length ~76 words (range 34–166). Aim for 60–90 words.

3–5 sentences in a single paragraph.

Must open with “[N] - jump arc that …”.
[N] represents the number of jumps in the arc

Must close with “By the end of this arc, …”.

Required beats (in order)

Open with the count and mission
“[JUMP_COUNT] - jump arc that [states purpose for the intended audience].”

Scope of transformation
Name the core dimensions trained (e.g., perception, energy, expression, embodiment).

Mechanism flavor
Nod to how it works (identity calibration, immersion, spatial entrainment, collective sync, archetypal patterning) without listing jump types.

Outcome line
“By the end of this arc, [state the lived capability or stance]” (no promises; describe capacity).

Language rules

Use concrete verbs: trains, refines, stabilizes, widens, encodes, integrates.

List up to 3 items with commas: “clarity, rhythm, and presence.”

Prefer that/in which for clause linkage. Avoid clunky “where connects you…”.

Avoid future-tense guarantees. Describe installed capacities, not results.

Keep it breath-friendly: no run-ons; each sentence earns its place.

Templates
Template A (with jump count)
“[COUNT] - jump arc that [mission for audience or domain]. It [names the faculties or layers it develops] and [mechanism flavor if helpful]. By the end of this arc, [concise, lived capability the practitioner can inhabit].”
Template B (no count available)
“An arc that [mission for audience or domain]. It [names core capacities] and [mechanism flavor]. By the end of this arc, [lived capability].”
Micro-examples (styled to your corpus)

Master Kriya Practitioner
“30 - jump arc that trains householder practitioners in the Lahiri lineage to cultivate steady rhythm, precise energetic literacy, and breath-born stillness in ordinary life. It refines attention, posture, and subtle perception and integrates ethical alignment, daily routine, and compassionate conduct. Through identity calibration, immersive fieldwork, archetypal attunement, and collective synchrony, practice stabilizes without strain and depth unfolds naturally. By the end of this arc, a calm, disciplined stance sustains deep meditation and quietly serves life with clarity and grace.”

The Expression of Power
“20 - jump arc that rebuilds one's relationship with power from the inside out. Through these jumps, one dissolves inherited fears and distortions, activates authentic strength, and reclaims one's sovereign presence. Power becomes something stable, embodied, and natural - not performed or projected, but lived as clear, anchored resonance. By the end of this arc, power is no longer something one uses - it is something one is.”

The Living Archive
“20 - jump arc that strengthens how you remember and what you retain in real life. It trains first-pass encoding, on-demand retrieval, and long-term consolidation. It also clears emotional static and integrates a simple external system that catches what the mind should not carry. It works through identity calibration and timeline immersion in spaces and collectives shaped by archetypal patterning. By the end of this arc, you retain more after one exposure, recall under pressure, and rely on a clean, trustworthy archive you can use anywhere.”

QA checklist (use before approving any arc description)

Count present and correct (if known): “[N] - jump arc …”

Single paragraph, 60–90 words, 3–5 sentences.

Mission stated in sentence 1.

Scope named (what’s being trained) in sentence 2.

Mechanism flavor included (identity/immersion/space/collective/archetype) without over-explaining.

Outcome line begins “By the end of this arc,” and describes installed capacity (not promises).

Encoding hygiene: ASCII punctuation, standard hyphen only.
