DESCRIPTION

Goal
Write a single, clean sentence that introduces the meeting with a mastered version of self, states what they do or share in practical terms, and ends with the arc/section reference.

Fixed Rules
1) Start exactly: A meeting with a version of yourself who [action 1]
2) Actions: list exactly two present-tense verb phrases as “who [action 1], [action 2]”
3) Punctuation: use exactly two commas — after action 1, and before “Section”
4) End exactly: within [Arc Title], Section [N]: [Section Title].
5) Constraints: one sentence, plain language, present tense, ASCII only

Template
A meeting with a version of yourself who [verb phrase 1], [verb phrase 2] within [Arc Title], Section [N]: [Section Title].

Examples (from The Living Archive)
• A meeting with a version of yourself who recalls steadily and calmly, sharing a tiny pre-recall routine and cue phrases you can reuse within The Living Archive, Section 1: Build and Recall.
• A meeting with a version of yourself who always notes origin and date as you learn, installing simple source-tag habits for clean and trustworthy memory within The Living Archive, Section 3: Clean Archive and Trust.
• A meeting with a version of yourself who judges clearly what is known and what needs review, calibrating meta memory and guiding smart study within The Living Archive, Section 3: Clean Archive and Trust.

BENEFIT

Goal
Name how the mirrored self calibrates identity in real life, and close with the arc/section reference.

Rules
1) Two sentences total.
   a) Sentence 1 begins exactly: Calibrates identity by mirroring a mastered version of self who ...
   b) Sentence 2 begins with You ... and lists practical outcomes in plain language.
2) Close sentence 2 with: within [Arc Title], Section [N]: [Section Title].
3) Use commas to separate outcomes; keep it concrete and desirable.

Template
Calibrates identity by mirroring a mastered version of self who [trait/action]. You [outcome 1], [outcome 2], and [outcome 3] within [Arc Title], Section [N]: [Section Title].

Examples (from The Living Archive)
• Calibrates identity by mirroring a mastered version of self who recalls steadily and calmly. You adopt a brief pre-recall routine (breath, cue phrase, posture), cut tip-of-the-tongue moments, and pull names and facts mid-conversation or on stage without scrambling within The Living Archive, Section 1: Build and Recall.
• Calibrates identity by mirroring a mastered version of self who source-tags by default. You note origin and date as you learn, keep clean links and citations, reduce false memories, and fact-check faster for trustworthy recall within The Living Archive, Section 3: Clean Archive and Trust.
• Calibrates identity by mirroring a mastered version of self who judges clearly what is solid and what needs review. You tune meta memory, build smart study lists, avoid overconfident mistakes, and test yourself precisely within The Living Archive, Section 3: Clean Archive and Trust.
